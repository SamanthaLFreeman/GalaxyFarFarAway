### The learning goals and objectives for this project are as follows: 
In this project we display a scrolling text as an opening. When a user chooses a category "People", "Planets", or "Vehicle", they can see all the cards available with information about the topic on each card. The user can star multiple cards which are then put into their favorites. The favorites can be displayed when the user clicks the "view favorites" button which also has a favorites counter on it. If there are no cards favorited, a message to inform the user that they have not chosen favorites is displayed. A user can remove favorites from their category or from the favorites display.
